# Lab 2b: Introduction to Docker

## Section 2

> [!IMPORTANT] > **Exercise:** Take note of the name assigned to your container.

The name of the container is `hardcore_grothendieck`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Is test-file still present? Why?

`test-file` is not present in this new container because docker containers are isolated, meaning that a file created in a container is not available to other containers even if running the same image.

When running `htop` on a docker container, it will only show the resources of the container. Running the same command on a traditional VM would show the resources of the entire operating system

The CPU usage has increased for both CPUs.
However, the --cpus flag does not necessarily prevent the container from using multiple CPU cores if available; it restricts the container to a specified fraction of the total CPU resources. So we can see that both CPUs are being used by the stress test.

The two containers can communicate with each other using ping. They can also ping the host machine. They can also access the internet. Docker uses a bridge network through which the connected containers can communicate with each other using addresses in the range of `172.17.0.X`
